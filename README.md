# Slaarti's Sewing App Tap

Just a little personal Homebrew tap for Casks and/or Formulae (probably
mostly Casks) for sewing layout applications for Mac. I claim no ownership
for the software being installed.

And hey, if anyone else finds this and finds it useful, then cool.

## How do I install these formulae?
`brew install slaarti/sewing/<formula>`

Or `brew tap slaarti/sewing` and then `brew install <formula>`.

## Documentation
`brew help`, `man brew` or check [Homebrew's documentation](https://docs.brew.sh).
